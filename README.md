# From-Scratch-Decision-Tree

# Conclusion

- Successfully built a decision tree classifier **from scratch** for the Page Block Classification dataset.
- Achieved a **high accuracy of over 96%** using the custom decision tree, closely matching scikit-learnâ€™s performance.
- Implemented core functionalities including:
    - Gini Impurity calculation
    - Information Gain-based node splitting
    - Recursive tree construction
    - Prediction using the trained tree
- Compared the custom-built model against scikit-learn's **`DecisionTreeClassifier`** to validate correctness and performance.
- Observed longer training time in the custom model compared to the optimized library version (as expected).
- Included precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to give a complete view of model performance.
- This project offered deep insights into how decision trees work at a fundamental level and demonstrated the effectiveness of such models in document layout classification tasks.
